# Mapsforge Map-Writer

The Mapsforge Map-Writer is a plug-in for the OpenStreetMap Osmosis Tool to convert OSM data files into maps that can be displayed with mapsforge.

This documentation is intended for those who want to create map files for use with mapsforge.

If you have any questions or problems, don't hesitate to ask our public [mapsforge-dev](https://groups.google.com/group/mapsforge-dev) mailing list for help. You can also report bugs and improvement requests via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge/issues).

## Introduction

This document describes the mapsforge map-writer plugin. It allows to convert OpenStreetMap data into the .map format which is needed to display maps with mapsforge-based applications. The tool is implemented as a plugin to the [Osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) software. To use the tool, you are required to have a working installation of Osmosis and the writer plugin copied to the plugins directory of Osmosis. You should also be familiar with the Osmosis tool.

The mapsforge writer has not changed significantly from version 0.3 and files generated with either version can be loaded into mapsforge applications 0.4.+

## Plugin Usage

- Activate the plugin with the Osmosis parameter ‘--mapfile-writer’, or short ‘--mw’.
- The plugin requires an input stream of valid OSM data. Use for example the MySQL, PostGIS, XML or PBF-Binary tasks of Osmosis to read OSM data.
- Use the following optional parameters to configure the process of map creation:

### Examples

- Write map file for Berlin using Binary-PBF format and writing into file /tmp/berlin.map:<br/>`$ bin/osmosis --rb file=../data/berlin.osm.pbf --mapfile-writer file=/tmp/berlin.map`<br/>
- Write map file for Germany using Binary-PBF format and writing into file /tmp/germany.map, setting the processing mode to hard disk:<br/>`$ bin/osmosis --rb file=../data/germany.osm.pbf --mapfile-writer file=/tmp/germany.map type=hd`<br/>
- Write map file for Bremen using XML format and writing into file /tmp/bremen.map, setting map start position to Bremen HBF:<br/>`$ bin/osmosis --rx file=../data/bremen.osm --mapfile-writer file=/tmp/bremen.map map-start-position=53.083418,8.81376`<br/>
- Write map file for Berlin-Dahlem. Data has been exported as XML from OSM website, so that we must use a bounding box definition:<br/>`$ bin/osmosis --rx file=../data/dahlem.osm --mw file=/tmp/dahlem-high.map bbox=52.4477300,13.2756600,52.4588200,13.2986600 `

### Known Pitfalls

- The plugin requires a bounding box definition, which is either included in the data or is given via the command line parameter `bbox`. Take note that the XML export functionality of the OSM website currently produces invalid bounding box definitions, so that the `bbox` parameter must be used in this case.
- If you installed the plugin into the user home, please make sure that you run osmosis with exactly this user and not with another user (e.g. the root user).
- There is a potential issue with tile grid artifacts inside areas at zoom levels 12-13, specially if they have stroke or semi-transparent fill. To solve this you can try a different zoom interval:
```bash
zoom-interval-conf=5,0,7,10,8,11,12,12,13,14,14,21
```

## Plugin Installation

- Download the release or snapshot writer plugin (**jar-with-dependencies**) from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.mapsforge%22) or [Sonatype OSS Repository Hosting](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mapsforge/) and read the Osmosis [documentation](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Detailed_Usage#Plugin_Tasks) for how to install a plugin.
- You may want to increase the Java heap space that may be allocated for osmosis. You can do so by editing the script $OSMOSIS_HOME/bin/osmosis(.bat). Insert a line with 'JAVACMD_OPTIONS=-Xmx800m'. This sets the maximum available Java heap space to 800M. Of course you can set this parameter to a value which ever fits best for your purpose.
- See http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Installation for further information about Osmosis usage.

### Installation Example

- Let the home directory of the user ($USER_HOME) be "/home/prometheus/".
- Let the directory where osmosis has been extracted to ($OSMOSIS_HOME) be "/home/prometheus/development/osm/osmosis/osmosis-0.40.1/".
- Create the directory "/home/prometheus/.openstreetmap/osmosis/plugins/" and copy the mapsforge-map-writer-x.x.x.jar to this directory.

### Hardware Requirements

The currently realeased version of the map-writer gives you the choice of either processing the input data completely in main memory or using the hard disk for storing temporary data structures. You can switch between these processing modes by using the 'type' parameter, see Plugin Usage below.

We recommend using the main memory mode only for small input files (< 200 MB in PBF format) as it requires quite a huge amount of memory (about ten times the size of the input file).

## Land/Sea Feature Encoding

For a minimum compatibility of maps generated, the following standard for encoding land and sea areas is suggested:
 - either have a single sea polygon at the bottom or more complex sea polygons (this is really up to map makers to decide, the single sea polygon is smaller in the map file but has the effect of some double drawing), tag natural=sea
 - define land areas with tag natural=nosea
 - everything else

It is encouraged to include land/sea areas for the entire bbox of the map (so even if the real map data covers just one irregularly shaped polygon, the land/sea should be for the whole bbox), the overhead is often not great and the result looks much better on maps.

The old practice of implicitly assuming that the background is land-coloured and not defining land areas is deprecated. 

## Defining a Custom Tag Mapping via XML

This section describes how to configure the ***known tag set*** via an XML file. The *known tag set* comprises all OSM tags (for ways and POIs) that are known to the renderer. You can use the XML configuration to define which subset of the known tag set should be included in the map file and to configure the zoom levels on which map objects first appear.

The default internal tag mapping defined in https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge/blob/master/mapsforge-map-writer/src/main/config/tag-mapping.xml is kept in sync with the known tag set of the renderer. So, if you want to define your own custom mapping use the internal mapping as a reference.
Please consult the XML-Schema documentation of https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge/blob/master/resources/tag-mapping.xsd to learn about how to implement your custom mapping. The XML-Schema is very easy to understand. We recommend to use Eclipse as an editor for XML as it allows for auto-completion if you provide an XML-Schema.

You need to be aware that this configuration only defines what data is to be included in the map file. How the data is eventually rendered is specified by a rule-set that is attached to the renderer. So if you add any tag to the writer’s tag configuration that is not recognized by the renderer, it will not be displayed in the map. In this case, you have to make sure that you also define in which way the new tag is to be rendered. How to configure the rendering is described in the article.

- computes the distribution of tags in the input file and based on this assigns internal ids in an optimized fashion, reduces file size
- polygon clipping is more restrictive due to a conceptual problem with clipping outlined (instead of filled) polygons, increases file size (admittedly overcompensates file size reduction mentioned above)
- bug fixes

### 0.2.1

- supports hard disk as temporary storage device, reduces required amount of main memory significantly, see Hardware Requirements below
- support for MS Windows platform
- removed dependency on JTS library
