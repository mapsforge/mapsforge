# Changelog

<wiki:toc />

## Version 0.5.0rc2

- Fixes to Rendertheme V4 with most notably improved tiling of area shaders.
- Smaller internal bug fixes and software updates.

## Version 0.5.0rc1

These are (some of) the changes in the as yet unreleased 0.5.x version.
- Rendertheme V4.
- Scalebar now with the option of using two units at the same time. New unit: nautical.
- Line breaks in labels: this is the most fragile change at the moment as it does not play well with the label placement algorithm.
- Improved tile caching: bugs fixed and optional threading for better performance.
- TileStoreLayer using the standard TMS directory layout of zoomlevel/y/x.
- New SVG library having better compliance with SVG spec.
- New render theme xml parser for better performance.
- Caching of rendered SVG symbols & delayed rendering.
- Simplify map writer plugin installation in Osmosis.

## Version 0.4.3

No functionality change, but mapsforge-map-android now build as a jar (not apklib) for Maven Central downloads.

## Version 0.4.2

No functionality change, but mapsforge build against mapsforge svg-android.

## Version 0.4.1

No functionality change, but version 0.4.1 is now available from Maven Central.

## Version 0.4.0

Version 0.4.0 is what during a period was known as the 'rescue' branch. It is based on an extensive rewrite of the mapsforge library that is incompatible with the previous releases. The mapfile format however has not changed and map files from 0.3 can still be used. 

- Better modular design of the entire project.
- Support for Java-only applications, see the SwingMapViewer subproject.
- Map views are not directly coupled to activities any more and can be used with modern Android design concepts.
- More flexible overlay model.
- Tightened-up memory handling.
- Support for device screen scaling.
- Support for SVG files as map icons.
- Gradle as build system in addition to Maven.
- Updated icons of default render theme.

For a demonstration of the capabilities refer to the Samples app.
