# Description of important conventions in the mapsforge project.

# Project conventions

Our project conventions are based on the official [Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html). In addition to these conventions, the following rules apply to all project members.


## Language and character encoding

We use only English in our project. Therefore all names of packages, files, methods, variables as well as all comments, debug output and commit messages must be in English.

The Eclipse IDE comes with a built-in spell checker that should be used. It can be activated via `Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Spelling`.

Please use UTF-8 encoding and Unix line breaks ('\n') for all source files, comments and other written documentation. 


## Committing to the repository

Each commit must have a proper comment, which summarises all its modifications. Whenever possible, changes that logically belong together should also be uploaded in a single commit.


## Java specific conventions

### Code style

We work with the Eclipse IDE and use the integrated code formatter. Our main Eclipse project contains a profile for the Java code formatter named *mapsforge*. Before committing Java code to the repository, this code style must be applied to all modified source files.

Please do not modify the mapsforge profile without approval of the other project members.


### Visibility

Please keep the visibility of all classes, methods and fields to a minimum. Use `public` modifiers only if necessary.


### Javadoc

We use Javadoc for documentation purposes. All important classes, methods and fields need a proper Javadoc comment. When writing a Javadoc comment for a method, all parameters and the return value must be documented. Please update Javadoc comments whenever the related code has been changed.

In general you should follow the [Sun conventions for writing documentation comments](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html).


### Compiler warnings

Many common Java programming mistakes can be avoided by enabling compiler checks. Malformed Javadoc comments or missing Javadoc tags are also unnecessary. As we try to prevent erroneous Java code and bad Javadoc comments, we enable all compiler warnings that enforce a higher level of code quality and readability. You can check the compiler settings of an Eclipse project via `Properties > Java Compiler > Errors/Warnings` and `Properties > Java Compiler > Javadoc`.

If possible, all warnings should be solved by the originator. Ask other developers for help if you don't know why a certain warning is raised or how to solve it correctly.

Do not use `@SupressWarnings` annotations to hide warnings. Do not commit code that triggers a lot of warnings. Never commit code that cannot be compiled and thus renders the whole project unusable for all other developers.

Please do not modify the compiler settings without approval of the other project members.
