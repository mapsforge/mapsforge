# Specification: Mapsforge Binary Map File Format

<wiki:toc />

## Conceptual design

The *mapsforge binary map file format* is designed for map rendering on devices with limited resources like mobile phones.
It allows for efficient storage of geographical information (e.g. OpenStreetMap data), fast tile-based access,
and filtering of map objects by zoom level.

The map file consists of several sub-files, each storing the map objects for a different zoom interval. Zoom intervals are non-overlapping groups of consecutive zoom levels. Each zoom interval is represented by a single member of the group, the so-called *base zoom level*. 


## General remarks

- All latitude and longitude coordinates are stored in microdegrees (degrees Ã— 10<sup>6</sup>).
- Numeric fields with a fixed byte size are stored with *Big Endian* byte order.
- Unsigned numeric fields with a variable byte encoding are marked with *`VBE-U` INT* and stored as follows:
  - the first bit of each byte is used for continuation info, the other seven bits for data.
  - the value of the first bit is 1 if the following byte belongs to the field, 0 otherwise.
  - each byte holds seven bits of the numeric value, starting with the least significant ones.
- Signed numeric fields with a variable byte encoding are marked with *`VBE-S` INT* and stored as follows:
  - the first bit of each byte is used for continuation info, the other six (last byte) or seven (all other bytes) bits for data.
  - the value of the first bit is 1 if the following byte belongs to the field, 0 otherwise.
  - each byte holds six (last byte) or seven (all other bytes) bits of the numeric value, starting with the least significant ones.
  - the second bit in the last byte indicates the sign of the number. A value of 0 means positive, 1 negative.
- All strings are stored in UTF-8 as follows:
  - the length *L* of the UTF-8 encoded string in bytes as *`VBE-U` INT*.
  - *L* bytes for the UTF-8 encoding of the string.


## File structure

For each zoom interval a so called **sub-file** is created. A sub-file consists of a **tile index segment** that stores a fixed-size pointer for each tile created in the **tile data segment**. The order of storing tiles to the tile data segment and their corresponding pointers to the tile index segment is row-wise and within a row column-wise. Rows and columns are inherently given by the grid layout of the tiles that is defined by the rectangular bounding box. For each tile in the grid, meta information is available in the **tile header** accompanied by its payload data (POIs and ways).

To read the data of a specific tile in the sub-file, the position of the fixed-size pointer in the index can be computed from the tile coordinates. The index entry points to the offset in the sub-file where the data is stored. Tile coordinates are implicitly given due to the structure of the tile index, thus no tile coordinates need to be stored along each tile.
