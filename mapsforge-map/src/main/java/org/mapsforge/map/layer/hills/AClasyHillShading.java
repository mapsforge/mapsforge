/**
 * <p>
 * Clear asymmetry hill shading.
 * There is a special azimuthal asymmetry factor, between 0 and 1, which determines in a simple way how much less shading
 * slopes in a reference direction get (northwest by convention):
 * When 1 slopes in the reference direction will get minimal shading (max asymmetry effect),
 * when 0 the shading will be symmetrical in all directions (no asymmetry effect).
 * Any value larger than 0 will make the shading smoothly asymmetrical, with slopes closer to the reference direction
 * less shaded than slopes in the opposite direction as the factor increases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Horizontal surfaces, or all surfaces with slope less than {@code minSlope}, will have minimum shade.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Slopes are shaded linearly by default, ie. main shade (shade before applying azimuthal asymmetry factor) is a linear function of slope, for performance.
 * Sqrt and square mappings are also available and can be used by overriding the {@link #slopeToShade(double)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For performance reasons, azimuthal asymmetry is also a linear function of the azimuth angle cosine.
 * This can be customized by overriding the {@link #azimuthalAsymmetryFactor(double)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are many behaviors you can modify by overriding methods if you know what you're doing:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link #azimuthalDotProduct(double, double)} to change the "light source" direction (NW by default),
 * <br />
 * {@link #azimuthalAsymmetryFactor(double)} to change the mapping of azimuth angle cosine to asymmetry factor,
 * <br />
 * {@link #slopeToShade(double)} to change the mapping of slope to shade,
 * <br />
 * {@link #normalToShade(double, double, double)} to change the whole 3D normal to shade mapping.
 * </p>
